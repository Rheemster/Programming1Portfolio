## 2017 - 2018 School Year

During this school year I took a Programming 1 class.  During this class, we learned the basics of coding.  We used Java for the first semester, and then switched to whatever language we desired for semester 2.  Python was my language of choice.

## Projects

Listed here are some of the various projects I worked on.

### Pipes Screensaver

This was one of my earlier projects, so it may not be too technically impressive, but I'm very happy as to how it came out.  It was created using the Proccessing environment.

### Calculator

This was one of the larger projects we tackled during this class.  We were tasked to create a functioning calculator application.  We used the Proccessing environment here as well.

### Chess

This was the largest project we developed during the year.  A team of 3 others and I worked to create a working chess game.  We opted for the Proccessing environment for this project as well, though we used the Python development mode to write the code.
